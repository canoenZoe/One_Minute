////Work's Method
For me , working within  a team is a greatfull experience ;during the "TP" , i try usually to understand the ideas of my colleagues 
and mainly try to explain mine.
the most important thing that i try to get it after each meeting is to gather what Mr, Michaël Launay  tells us and what we sugggess to do
as a srategy.Even between us , we have really many points of view, so that to make a collective decision is really so interesting.

Difficulties
if i will speak about difficulties  , i will start by the différence of language with our responsible 
and with my colleagues.after each meetiig , and whan i come back to home i try to remember the most important suggession, 
sentences and even words and i start "traduction service" , it takes much time  .
Besides, one of the most things that was 
difficult for me, is that our project seems to be clear in his glabal view:"take an order inside a restaurant", but  some 
details about at which level we are limited to designing this application ; should we just take into consideration "the service  give by the waiter"
or may be be so selective when we had to choose the performance evaluation criterion(good service/client satisfaction/price/time taken by the application),
make it a bit complicated
